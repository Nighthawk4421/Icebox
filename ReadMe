This is an icebox that I was working on. I do realize there is one that is done by Menan-Ak47 but I just simply wanted to push myself and try to see if I could get the clothing variation to toggle. Feel free to make new issues and/or pull requests so that we can all make this better. Should you contribute code, we go on the honor system so please test your code before posting under pull requests or issues! Thanks again and have a wonderful day!
